Step 1: Setup Your Development Environment

Install necessary Python packages:

pip install streamlit transformers soundfile numpy


Register on Hugging Face and obtain your API key (if the IBM model requires authentication).

Step 2: Design the Streamlit Interface

Create an interface to:

Upload or paste the book text.

Select voice options (if multiple IBM voices available).

Control playback speed or other settings.

Example snippet:

import streamlit as st

st.title("Echoverse - AI Audiobook Creator")
text = st.text_area("Paste your book text here:", height=300)
voice = st.selectbox("Choose voice:", ["IBM Voice 1", "IBM Voice 2"])

Step 3: Text Preprocessing

Clean input text (remove unwanted characters, normalize numbers).

Split text into smaller chunks (e.g., paragraphs or sentences) to avoid TTS input limits.

Step 4: Load IBM TTS Model from Hugging Face

Use Hugging Face’s transformers pipeline or tts library to load the IBM model.

Example:

from transformers import pipeline

tts_pipeline = pipeline("text-to-speech", model="ibm/tts-model-name")

Step 5: Generate Audio from Text

Loop through the text chunks, synthesize audio for each.

Collect audio segments in memory for concatenation.

audio_segments = []
for chunk in text_chunks:
    audio_output = tts_pipeline(chunk)
    audio_segments.append(audio_output["audio"])

Step 6: Post-Process and Combine Audio

Convert audio segments into consistent format.

Concatenate audio chunks into a single audio stream.

Optionally apply noise reduction or normalization.

Step 7: Playback and Download Feature in Streamlit

Use Streamlit’s audio widget to play generated audio.

Provide a download button for users to save the audiobook file.

import io

combined_audio = combine_audio_segments(audio_segments)  # implement combining logic
audio_buffer = io.BytesIO()
save_audio_to_buffer(combined_audio, audio_buffer)  # implement saving logic

st.audio(audio_buffer)
st.download_button("Download Audiobook", data=audio_buffer, file_name="echoverse_audiobook.wav")

Step 8: Additional Features (Optional)

Allow voice cloning or custom voice uploads.

Add background music or ambient sounds.

Implement chapter-wise audio export.
